INTRODUCTION:

As we know that environmental issues are raising and worsening day by day.Global warming and climate change is the biggest fear in this time. The only way to deal with this
problem is to create awareness among people and plantion of trees. So in this context our team has tried to make the app (EcoHealing) so that the interested people could share 
their ideas for saving the naature. And it also aware the people about the problems who are unaware about them. To make the app user friendly we have made the app with beautiful 
presentation.

CONCEPTS USED:

In our app we have created many post screens:-

2. For getting the ideas from the user we have connected our app to google firebase realtime database and created the button to view the uploaded ideas.

3. Interesting facts related to the nature are showed in the recycler card view.

4. We have also created the portal to upload the image of any plant planted by the user or any creative initiative which they would like to share. For doing so we have connected 
our app to firebase storage.

Except all of this we have used animated splash screen and colourful layout to make app user interactive...
We hope that our app would create some awareness among the users regarding the nature and all the people will do their part to save the environment.
